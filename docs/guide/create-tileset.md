# Step 2. Create a tileset for the map

## Prerequisites

1. You must have an image representing the tileset
2. To create a tileset, you need the Tiled Map Editor :Â [https://www.mapeditor.org/](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

## It is necessary to know

1. Tile sizes may vary. In the example below, the size is 32px*32px but you can have more or less tile size.
2. The width and height of the tileset does not matter. However, avoid having images that are too large. This may cause an error with WebGL
3. You can have several tilesets for one map.

## Create a spritesheet for this tileset

Here is the spritesheet we will use:

![medieval](/assets/medieval.png)

> **Warning**, the image above is only a part of the tileset

::: danger
For a tileset compatible with WebGL 1 (mainly mobiles), the image must be at most 4096*4096px
:::

::: danger
The size of the tiles must not exceed the dimensions of the image. For example, if the width of a tile is 32px but the width of the tileset is 60px then there will be a problem. The width of the tileset must be 64px
:::

## Define collisions

### First of all

1. Create a new tileset with Tiled Map Editor (`File` > `New` > `New Tileset`)
2. Set source and width and height of tile
3. Save file to `medieval.tsx` in `src/server/maps/tmx`

![new tileset](/assets/new-tileset.png)

### Solution 1: Collision on a tile

1. Select the tile (or several at the same time) and set a new property

![select tile](/assets/select-tile.jpeg)

2. Add the `collision` property of type `BOOL`

![add colission](/assets/add-colission.png)

3. Check the `collision` property on the selected tile

![set collision](/assets/set-colission.jpeg)

### Solution 2: Precise collision with a polygon

![precise collision](/assets/precise-collision.png)

1. Select `Tile Collision Editor`
2. Choose the tile
3. Put a polygon on part having a collision

## Define overlays

To define an overlay, you have two solutions. Either indicate that the layer is above the events, or the tile itself

### Solution 1: Z layer

![layer-overlay](/assets/layer-overlay.png)

1. Click on the layer
2. Add a property by clicking on the plus icon

![z-value](/assets/z-value.png)

3. Add the property named `z` of `int` type 

![layer-z](/assets/layer-z.png)

The z value is the height (in number of tiles) in the terrain (grass for example) and the elements of the new layer.

For example, in the image above, 
- z = 0 (the grass, the hero's feet)
- z = 1 (The middle of the wall of the house, The middle of the wall of the house)
- z = 2 (The top of the wall of the house, the beginning of the roof of the house)
- z = 3 (The beginning of the chimney, the middle of the roof)
- z = 4 (The top of the roof)

> It is important to respect the z-positions. Because by putting good z values, you could later (in future versions of RPGJS) play with heights (make a bridge, make an object fall, etc.).

### Solution 2: Z tile (May be complementary with the first solution)

![z-tile](/assets/z-tile.png)

1. Select a tile
2. Set the `z` property

> Note that the z-value is added to the z-value of the layer. For example, in the image above, the top of the trunk is on z=1. But if the tree is on a layer of z=2 then the true value of the top of the trunk will be z=3.

##### Case of overlay of a tile with a precise collision

You may have problems with overlapping ([See above](#solution-2-precise-collision-with-a-polygon)). The image below shows the hero's feet over the bush

![overlay-problem](/assets/overlay-problem.png)

To remedy this problem, give the z-value on the tile correctly. Here, the bush is at the same level as the hero's feet. So we put z=0

![z-0](/assets/z-0.png)

The problem is solved!
