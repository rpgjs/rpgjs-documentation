### Change Speed
- **Enum**: `number`

| Tag           | Description |
| ------------- |------------:|
| Speed.Slowest | 0.2 |
| Speed.Slower | 0.5 |
| Speed.Slow | 1 |
| Speed.Normal | 3 |
| Speed.Fast | 5 |
| Speed.Faster | 7 |
| Speed.Fastest | 10 |
- **Property**: `player.speed`
- **Type**: <Type type='number' />
- **Optional**: `false`
- **Default**: `3` 
- **Usage**:

 
Changes the player's speed

```ts
player.speed = 1
```

You can use Speed enum

```ts
import { Speed } from '@rpgjs/server'
player.speed = Speed.Slow
```


---
### Block movement
- **Property**: `player.canMove`
- **Type**: <Type type='boolean' />
- **Optional**: `false`
- **Default**: `true` 
- **Usage**:

 
Blocks the movement. The player will not be able to move even if he presses the direction keys on the keyboard.

```ts
player.canMove = false
```


---
### Go through to other player
- **Property**: `player.throughOtherPlayer`
- **Type**: <Type type='boolean' />
- **Optional**: `false`
- **Default**: `true` 
- **Usage**:

 
The player passes through the other players (or vice versa). But the player does not go through the events.

```ts
player.throughOtherPlayer = true
```


---
### Go through the player
- **Property**: `player.through`
- **Type**: <Type type='boolean' />
- **Optional**: `false`
- **Default**: `false` 
- **Usage**:

 
The player goes through the event or the other players (or vice versa)

```ts
player.through = true
```


---
### Change Frequency
- **Enum**: `number`

| Tag           | Description |
| ------------- |------------:|
| Frequency.Lowest | 600 |
| Frequency.Lower | 400 |
| Frequency.Low | 200 |
| Frequency.High | 100 |
| Frequency.Higher | 50 |
| Frequency.Highest | 25 |
| Frequency.None | 0 |
- **Property**: `player.speed`
- **Type**: <Type type='number' />
- **Optional**: `false`
- **Default**: `0` 
- **Usage**:

 
The frequency allows to put a stop time between each movement in the array of the moveRoutes() method.
The value represents a dwell time in milliseconds. The higher the value, the slower the frequency.

```ts
player.frequency = 400
```

You can use Frequency enum

```ts
import { Frequency } from '@rpgjs/server'
player.frequency = Frequency.Low
```


---
### Give an itinerary
- **Method**: `player.moveRoutes(routes)`
- **Arguments**:
    - {<Type type='Array&lt <a href="/commands/move.html#move">Move</a>&gt;' />} `routes`.  (Optional: `false`)
- **Return**: <Type type='Promise' />  
- **Example**: 

```ts
import { Move } from '@rpgjs/server'

await player.moveRoutes([ Move.tileLeft(), Move.tileDown(2) ])
// The path is over when the promise is resolved
```
 
- **Usage**:


Gives an itinerary. 

You can create your own motion function:

```ts
import { Direction } from '@rpgjs/server'

const customMove = () => {
     return [Direction.Left, Direction.Up]
}

player.moveRoutes([ customMove() ])
```

Your function can also return a function:

 ```ts
import { Direction, RpgPlayer } from '@rpgjs/server'

// This function can be found in another file. By returning a function, you have access to the player who is making a move.
const customMove = (otherPlayer: RpgPlayer) => {
     return (player: RpgPlayer, map) => {
         return otherPlayer.position.x > player.position.x ? Direction.Left : Direction.Right
     }
}

player.moveRoutes([ customMove(otherPlayer) ])
```

the function contains two parameters:

- `player`: the player concerned by the movement
- `map`: The information of the current map


---
### Infinite Move Routes
- **Method**: `player.infiniteMoveRoute(routes)`
- **Arguments**:
    - {<Type type='Array&lt <a href="/commands/move.html#move">Move</a>&gt;' />} `routes`.  (Optional: `false`)
- **Return**: <Type type='void' />  
- **Example**: 

```ts
import { Move } from '@rpgjs/server'

player.infiniteMoveRoute([ Move.tileRandom() ])
```
 
- **Usage**:


Giving a path that repeats itself in a loop to a character

You can stop the movement at any time with `breakRoutes()` and replay it with `replayRoutes()`.


---
### Stop an infinite movement
- **Method**: `player.breakRoutes(force=false)`
- **Arguments**:
    - {<Type type='boolean' />} `force`. Forces the stop of the infinite movement (Optional: `true`)
- **Return**: <Type type='void' />  
- **Example**: 

```ts
import { Move } from '@rpgjs/server'

player.infiniteMoveRoute([ Move.tileRandom() ])
player.breakRoutes(true)
```
 
- **Usage**:


Works only for infinite movements. You must first use the method `infiniteMoveRoute()`


---
### Replay an infinite movement
- **Method**: `player.replayRoutes()`
- **Return**: <Type type='void' />  
- **Example**: 

```ts
import { Move } from '@rpgjs/server'

player.infiniteMoveRoute([ Move.tileRandom() ])
player.breakRoutes(true)
player.replayRoutes()
```
 
- **Usage**:


Works only for infinite movements. You must first use the method `infiniteMoveRoute()`
If the road was stopped with `breakRoutes()`, you can restart it with this method


---
### Move To
- **Since**: 3.2.0
- **Method**: `player.moveTo()`
- **Arguments**:
    - {<Type type=' <a href="/commands/common.html">RpgPlayer</a> <a href="/classes/event.html">RpgEvent</a> <a href="/classes/shape.html">RpgShape</a>|Position' />} `target`. the target (Optional: `false`)
    - {<Type type='object' />} `options`. - animate. Set a boolean to use default parameters (Optional: `true`)
    - {<Type type='boolean' />} `options.infinite`. - moves infinitely towards the target, you have to stop its movement manually with the method `stopMoveTo()` (Optional: `true`)
    - {<Type type='() =&gt; void' />} `options.onComplete`. - Callback when the event arrives at the destination (Optional: `true`)
    - {<Type type='(duration:number) =&gt; void' />} `options.onStuck`. - callback when the event is blocked against a wall. Duration gives you the duration (in frames) of the blocking time (Optional: `true`)
- **Return**: <Type type='void' />  
- **Example**: 

```ts
import { Move } from '@rpgjs/server'

player.moveTo(otherPlayer)
```
 
- **Usage**:


Move the event to another event, a player, a shape or a specific position.
The event will avoid obstacles, but you can tell if it is stuck or has completed its path


---
### Stop Move To
